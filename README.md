# Open AI Agent SDK Experiment

This OpenAI Agent is created by a LangGraph Agent with a vector search tool. The OpenAI Agent SDK documentation been embedded in the vector store to serve as a reference for the Agent.

The LangGraph Agent returned wrongly:<br>
```async def write_to_markdown(ctx: RunContextWrapper, content: str, filename: str = "output.md")```
<br>
Correct declaration:<br>
```async def write_to_markdown(ctx: RunContextWrapper, content: str, filename: str)```<br>

_**You can compare (at the end of this page) the Agent generated with my LangGraph Agent and another Agent generated by OpenAI's CustomGPT. Both the LangGraph Agent and the CustomGPT are working with the same Agents SDK documentation and having the same system and user prompts!**_

================================== Ai Message ==================================<br>
To create an AI Agent using the OpenAI Agent SDK that can search the web in real-time, extract data based on user prompts, and write it to a markdown file, we will follow these steps:
<br>
1. **Install Required Libraries**: We need to install the `openai-agents` package.
2. **Set Up API Keys**: Ensure the OpenAI API key is set up in your environment.
3. **Create the Agent**: Define an agent using the OpenAI Agent SDK.
4. **Define Tools**: Use `WebSearchTool` for web searching and `FunctionTool` for writing to a markdown file.
5. **Run the Agent**: Use the `Runner` to execute the agent.

Here's the complete code to achieve this:

```python
# Install the required package
# !pip install openai-agents

import asyncio
from agents import Agent, Runner, function_tool, WebSearchTool
from agents.run_context import RunContextWrapper

# Define a function tool to write data to a markdown file
@function_tool
async def write_to_markdown(ctx: RunContextWrapper, content: str, filename: str = "output.md") -> str:
    """Writes the given content to a markdown file."""
    with open(filename, "w") as f:
        f.write(content)
    return f"Data written to {filename}"

# Create the agent
agent = Agent(
    name="WebSearchAgent",
    instructions="Search the web for the user's query and write the results to a markdown file.",
    tools=[
        WebSearchTool(),
        write_to_markdown
    ]
)

# Define the main function to run the agent
async def main():
    user_query = "Latest news on AI technology"
    result = await Runner.run(agent, user_query)
    print(result.final_output)

# Run the main function
await main()
```

### Libraries to Install
- `openai-agents`

### Required API Keys
- OpenAI API Key: Set this in your environment as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

This code sets up an agent that uses a web search tool to find information online and a function tool to write the results to a markdown file. The agent is executed using the `Runner` class, which handles the asynchronous execution of the agent's tasks.

# Latest Developments in AI Technology (March 2025)

## Advancements in AI and Robotics

- **Google's Integration of AI with Robotics**: Google has announced the integration of its advanced Gemini 2.0 AI language models with robotic systems capable of performing physical actions. This initiative aims to create more versatile robots but also introduces new categories of risk as AI begins to take on physical capabilities. ([axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/03/12/google-humanoid-robotics-gemini-deepmind?utm_source=openai))

- **Google DeepMind's New AI Models**: Google DeepMind has introduced new AI models, Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER, designed to enhance the practicality of general-purpose robots in real-world settings. These models enable robots to perform complex tasks such as folding origami, organizing a desk, and playing basketball.

## Legal and Regulatory Developments

- **French Publishers Sue Meta**: French publishers and authors have filed a lawsuit against Meta, accusing the company of using their copyrighted works without permission to train its AI models. The plaintiffs demand the removal of data directories created by Meta for AI training, highlighting ongoing tensions between creative industries and tech companies over data usage.

# OpenAI Agents SDK Agent generated by OpenAI CustomGPT

_**In short nowhere near close to how it should look like**_

================================== GPT ==================================<br>
Hereâ€™s the AI Agent implementation using the OpenAI Agent SDK. This agent will:

1. Search the web in real-time based on user queries.
2. Extract the required data.
3. Write the extracted data into a markdown file.

**Requirements**
You'll need to install the following libraries:

```pip install openai openai-agents markdownify```

**API Keys Required**

OpenAI API key (for using the Agent SDK)


```
import openai
import markdownify
import json
from openai import Assistant
from openai.types.beta import Tool, FunctionTool
from typing import List
from openai.beta import tools
import requests

# Define tool for web search
def web_search(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the web and return extracted results."""
    response = requests.get(f"https://api.duckduckgo.com/?q={query}&format=json")
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        return json.dumps(data.get("RelatedTopics", []))
    else:
        return "Error: Unable to fetch search results."

# Define tool for markdown writing
def write_markdown(content: str, filename: str = "output.md"):
    """Write extracted content into a markdown file."""
    with open(filename, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        f.write(markdownify.markdownify(content))
    return f"Data written to {filename}"

# Define the AI agent
tools_list: List[Tool] = [
    FunctionTool(name="web_search", function=web_search, description="Search the web in real-time"),
    FunctionTool(name="write_markdown", function=write_markdown, description="Write content into a markdown file")
]

# Create the AI Assistant
assistant = Assistant.create(
    name="Web Data Extractor",
    instructions="Use tools to fetch web data and save it in markdown format.",
    tools=tools_list
)

# Example Usage
def run_agent(query: str):
    """Run the AI Agent to search the web and save data in markdown."""
    search_results = web_search(query)
    formatted_results = json.loads(search_results)
    content = "\n".join([item["Text"] for item in formatted_results if "Text" in item])
    return write_markdown(content)

# Example execution
query = "latest AI news"
result = run_agent(query)
print(result)
```
This AI Agent:

* Uses web_search to fetch real-time search results.
* Extracts relevant content.
* Writes it into a Markdown file using write_markdown.
